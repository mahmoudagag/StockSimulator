## Description

This software allows users to simulate buying stocks on the stock market. In the frontend, I'm using react to display html, handle information, and make api calls. In the back end,I'm using Django. With it, I'm constantly updating the database and sending needed information to the web application. I'm using the default sqlite.

## How To Use

Once signed in, users are initally given $50000. They can then search for different stocks. They are then given a chart of the stock with different time intervals. Users can also monitor their history of buying and selling stocks at what time. They can also follow along with their networth over time to see their progress.
